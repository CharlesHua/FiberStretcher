# FiberStretcher
This program is used to control the stepper motor in the physics experiment of fiber stretch.

The whole program can only work with special model stepper motor, because some of the functions are relied on the hardware. Also, some of the files, data base file, for example, can't be uploaded, because of the size limit of 25MB.
